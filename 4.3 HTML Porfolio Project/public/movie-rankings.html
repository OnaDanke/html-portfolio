<p>This movie has beautiful scenery and watching it in 3D actually brings the movie to life I believe.</p>

<h3>Batman: The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>Christopher Nolan's story telling of Batman in the trilogy is brilliant especially in the third one as the movie brings you to the edge of your seat more than the first two.</p>

<h3>V for Vendetta</h3>
<p>This political piece of cinematic mastery made me respect what Hugo Weaving could do with his craft while masked, I mean take how he introduced himself, he painted a picture with words like a true wordsmith. He delivered this amazing performance greater than most would unmasked in my opinion.</p>
