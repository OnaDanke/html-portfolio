<h1>About Onalenna Danke</h1>
<p>  I'm Onalenna Danke from a township in Tshwane (Pretoria) called Ga-Rankuwa, the fourth child in a family of seven. My family consists of my parents, father, mother and four siblings.</p>

<p>I attended Laerskool Warmbad before Warmbad's name got changed to Bela Bela and then later went to Prestige College in Hammanskraal.</p>

<p>Growing up, I  was a sporty/ active chap partaking in swimming, football, rugby and basketball, and then in my spare time I was clowning in class making people laugh so I enjoy being around people and interacting with them.</p>

<p>Now I live in the West Rand in a Township called Kagiso, which is in a town called Krugersdorp located West of Johannesburg and I work for the government on municipal level.</p>
